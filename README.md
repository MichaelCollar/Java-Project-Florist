A student project at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. The task was to write an application that simulates shopping at a self-service florist.
At the florist there are flowers, flowers have their names and colors. Flower prices can be found in the price list. Customers have names and some money. They choose flowers and put them on the shopping cart. Then they pay and repack flowers into a box.
